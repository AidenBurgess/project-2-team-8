## Dependencies
- This project requires the installation of JDK 14 or higher to run
- This project requires the installation of maven in some form, whether through commandline or through an IDE.
- The rest of the dependencies will be obtained when importing maven as a project, or when calling the compile or package lifestyle.

## Running the project
- In both of the following cases, a data folder named "data" containing data files must be present in the workspace. This can be obtained from the GitHub repository.
- Assuming that maven is present, calling the compile phase should create a jar with dependencies under the generated target folder with name "project-2-team-8-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar". The jar can then be run using the command `java -jar project-2-team-8-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
- As an alternative, as long as the pom.xml is imported to an IDE, the project can be built and run as normal through calling the IDE's built in build and run command. If troubles are encountered when running, the "java" folder under "main" may need to be manually marked as a source folder in the project structure, as well as the the "java" folder under "test" being marked as a test folder.
